# Impact of AI on Employment

This project investigates how the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has affected employment, revenue, and public sentiment across industries and countries. Using a structured dataset and advanced SQL queries, the analysis focuses on adoption trends, workforce impact, and tool-specific market performance.

## Project Objectives

- Rank industries and AI tools by adoption and trust levels
- Analyze regulatory sentiment and its influence on market dynamics
- Examine job loss, revenue growth, and human-AI collaboration trends
- Track changes over time and identify correlation patterns between adoption and impact

## Key Insights

- Stable Diffusion leads in market share; ChatGPT has the highest adoption rate
- Retail suffered the highest job losses, with low corresponding revenue growth
- Regulation level influences public sentiment and industry performance
- Some industries show a positive correlation between AI adoption and revenue, while others face trade-offs

## SQL Skills Demonstrated

- **Analytical Functions**: RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG for trend and performance tracking  
- **CTEs and Modular Queries**: For stepwise, readable multi-layered logic  
- **Advanced Aggregations**: To compute running totals, averages, and correlation proxies  
- **Conditional Mapping**: To quantify and label market sentiment based on regulation types  
- **Join Logic**: Combining AI tool, industry, and temporal data for layered analysis  
- **Insight-Driven Query Design**: Questions framed to uncover patterns and exceptions in the data


Beyond querying, this project integrates my own commentary and interpretation for each insight. Observations such as the fluctuating performance of AI tools over time, varying impacts across industries, and the trade-offs between automation and revenue were derived by linking metrics and framing narratives from the raw output. This blend of technical querying and business storytelling enhances the depth and clarity of the insights.
